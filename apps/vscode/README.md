# Callimachus for VS Code & Cursor

Search your AI coding-agent conversation history — across **Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Qwen, Goose, OpenCode, Continue, Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code** and in-app chats — without leaving the editor. Pick a past thread and open its full transcript as a markdown doc.

This extension is a thin client over the **`cal`** CLI, so it shares the exact same local index as the Callimachus desktop app and MCP server. No separate database, no separate indexing.

## Install

- **VS Code** — [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) (search "Callimachus").
- **Cursor / VSCodium** — [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/) (these editors install from Open VSX, not the VS Code Marketplace).
- **Manual** — download the `.vsix` from [Releases](../../../releases) and run *Extensions: Install from VSIX…*.

## Requirements

- The **Callimachus desktop app** installed and run at least once — it builds the index and puts the **`cal`** CLI on your `PATH`, which this extension shells out to. (Building `cal` yourself from a checkout: `cargo install --path apps/desktop/src-tauri --bin cal`; or set `callimachus.calPath` to its absolute path.)

## Sidebar

Click the **Callimachus** icon in the Activity Bar to open the **History** panel — a live search box over your whole AI-history index, with source/project scope, a recent-threads list, and a corpus-stats footer. It themes itself to your editor (light/dark/high-contrast).

Pick any result to open its full transcript as a rich tab, with one-click **Insert**, **Copy**, **Export**, and **Open in CLI** actions. Hover a row in the sidebar to insert or copy without opening it. **Export** writes a markdown note to your `callimachus.vaultPath` (or, if that's unset, opens it as an untitled document), and **Open in CLI** seeds the `callimachus.openCommand` agent with the thread's context.

## Ambient Recall

The sidebar can also work *without* you searching. With **Ambient Recall** on, it watches what you're looking at — the current selection, the symbol under the cursor, or the nearest error — and surfaces past threads related to it (via `cal related`), so prior context finds you instead of the other way around. Toggle it with the **Callimachus: Toggle Ambient Recall** command or the `callimachus.ambientRecall` setting; tune its timing and volume with the `ambientRecall*` settings below.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Callimachus: Search History** | Search every indexed source, pick a thread, open the transcript. |
| **Callimachus: Search History (current project)** | Same, scoped to the open workspace folder's path. |
| **Callimachus: Search History for Selection** | Use the current editor selection as the query. |
| **Callimachus: Recent Threads** | Browse the most recently updated threads. |
| **Callimachus: Insert Thread into Editor** | Insert a thread's transcript at the cursor (seed a chat / notes). |
| **Callimachus: Copy Thread Context** | Copy a thread's packed transcript to the clipboard. |
| **Callimachus: Toggle Ambient Recall** | Turn the sidebar's ambient-recall section on or off. |

There's also a **status-bar** button (`$(history) Callimachus`) that opens search.

## Settings

- `callimachus.calPath` — path to the `cal` binary (default `cal`). Leave as `cal` if it's on your `PATH`.
- `callimachus.resultLimit` — max results to fetch per search (default `40`).
- `callimachus.vaultPath` — Obsidian vault folder for the **Export** action (default empty). When empty, Export opens the note as an untitled document instead of writing to a vault.
- `callimachus.openCommand` — CLI agent the **Open in CLI** action seeds with a thread's context (default `claude`; e.g. `codex`, `gemini`). Must be on your `PATH`.
- `callimachus.ambientRecall` — surface past threads related to your selection / symbol / nearest error in the sidebar, with no searching (default `true`).
- `callimachus.ambientRecallThrottle` — milliseconds to wait after the cursor/selection settles before querying for related threads (default `500`).
- `callimachus.ambientRecallMinContext` — minimum length of the editor context (selection or symbol) before ambient recall runs (default `10`).
- `callimachus.ambientRecallLimit` — max related threads to show in the ambient-recall section (default `5`).

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install          # from the monorepo root (pulls @types/vscode etc.)
pnpm --filter callimachus-vscode build
# then press F5 in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host
pnpm --filter callimachus-vscode package   # build a .vsix with @vscode/vsce
```
